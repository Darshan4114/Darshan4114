  <summary><h3>👨‍💻 Darshan's Coding Journey</h3></summary>
  I started playing with electronics as a kid—Arduino, Raspberry Pi, you name it. Coding became a natural step, initially copying and pasting for projects. But I wanted more. So, I dove into Python and discovered Django, opening up a path to professional software development.

  Being a kid with no work experience, I faced a hiring struggle. To build a portfolio, I turned to YouTube, showcasing my coding journey. It worked, landing me my first job, but life got busy. My portfolio, blog, and YouTube channel took a hit, though the channel is slowly growing with around 956 subscribers today.

  I've worn many hats—startup gigs, freelancing, and diving into entrepreneurship and product building. Now, at a crossroads between building a product and finding a job, I've opted for both. Let's build something great while keeping the bills paid.
